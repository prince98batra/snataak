## Purpose of the Document

This document explains how to design **infrastructure monitoring dashboards** using tools like **Grafana**. It focuses on how the dashboards should be structured, what data they should show, and how they can help teams monitor system health efficiently.

## Need of Monitoring

| Why It's Needed          | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Early Issue Detection    | Helps identify problems (CPU high, memory full) before they cause downtime. |
| Real-Time System Health  | Shows live status of servers and services.                                  |
| Better Troubleshooting   | Easy to investigate alerts using graphs and stats.                          |
| Capacity Planning        | Understand trends to plan for scaling infrastructure.                       |
| Faster Incident Response | Allows teams to react quickly and reduce downtime.                          |

## Flow of Designing the Dashboard

| Step No. | Step Name             | Description                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1        | Identify Key Metrics  | Select what needs to be monitored (CPU, memory, disk, etc.). |
| 2        | Decide Panel Types    | Choose how to show data (gauge, graph, stat, bar).           |
| 3        | Group Related Metrics | Club similar items together (system, disk, network).         |
| 4        | Plan Layout           | Decide the screen layout – top to bottom arrangement.        |
| 5        | Build in Grafana      | Create the dashboard using Prometheus data source.           |
| 6        | Test & Improve        | Validate usability and adjust based on feedback.             |

## Dashboard Design Structure

| Section Name        | Panels Included                                    | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Header Section**  | Total servers, active alerts count (Stat panels)   | Quick summary of overall health              |
| **CPU Metrics**     | CPU usage (%), Load Average (Line + Gauge)         | Identify CPU stress and overutilization      |
| **Memory Section**  | Memory usage %, Swap usage % (Gauges)              | Show memory pressure or leaks                |
| **Disk Section**    | Disk usage (/var, /data), IOPS (Bar + Line charts) | Monitor disk space and performance           |
| **Network Section** | Ingress/Egress (bps), Packet Loss/Error (Line/Bar) | Check traffic flow and network errors        |
| **Services**        | Jenkins, DB, etc. up/down status (Stat panel)      | See if key services are running properly     |
| **Alerts View**     | Table of active alerts (severity-based color rows) | Display all current issues needing attention |

## Design Approach Details

### Layout

| Element            | Design Idea                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logical Order      | Start with summary, followed by detailed metric sections                    |
| Visual Balance     | Don’t overload one part of the screen; keep layout clean                    |
| Clear Titles       | Every panel should have a meaningful title                                  |
| Mobile/Desktop Fit | Design should work for both large and small screens (auto-fit where needed) |

### Panels

| Metric Type       | Panel Type Used | Color Thresholds (Example)        |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| CPU Usage         | Line Chart      | Yellow > 70%, Red > 90%           |
| Memory Usage      | Gauge           | Yellow > 75%, Red > 90%           |
| Swap Usage        | Gauge           | Yellow > 20%, Red > 50%           |
| Disk Usage        | Bar Chart       | Yellow > 70%, Red > 90%           |
| Network Bandwidth | Line Chart      | No color; used for traffic trends |
| Packet Errors     | Bar Chart       | Yellow > 0.5%, Red > 2%           |
| Process Health    | Stat Panel      | Green = UP, Red = DOWN            |
| Alerts Table      | Table           | Rows colored by severity          |

---

### Grouping Logic

| Group Name    | Metrics Included                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **System**    | CPU, Load Average, Memory, Swap                     |
| **Disk**      | Filesystem Usage, IOPS                              |
| **Network**   | Ingress/Egress, Errors, Drops                       |
| **Processes** | Jenkins, Database, Other critical service status    |
| **Alerts**    | Table showing active Prometheus/Alertmanager alerts |

### User-Focused Visualization Best Practices

| Best Practice                       | Why It Helps                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use color coding (green/yellow/red) | Makes it easy to spot problems instantly                         |
| Limit panel count per screen        | Avoids clutter, keeps dashboards readable                        |
| Use time filters (e.g., 5m, 1h)     | Helps users adjust timeframe as needed                           |
| Include helpful labels/tooltips     | Improves usability and understanding of each panel               |
| Use variables (e.g., instance/env)  | Allows reuse of dashboards for different servers or environments |
| Group similar metrics visually      | Helps in fast diagnosis (CPU issues vs Disk vs Network)          |
