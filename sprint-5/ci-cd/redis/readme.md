## Overview  
This document defines the monitoring strategy, alert rules, severity levels, notification channels, and escalation process for Redis, which acts as a key middleware caching layer. The objective is to ensure early detection of performance issues and minimize downtime across environments.

## Monitoring Components

### Redis Monitoring Metrics  
Key metrics to monitor for Redis:  

| Metric               | Description                              | Alert Threshold                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Memory Usage         | High memory consumption (>90%)          | `>90% of maxmemory`                 |
| CPU Utilization      | High CPU usage (>80%)                   | `>80% for 5 mins`                   |
| Latency              | Slow response times (>100ms avg)        | `>100ms for 5 mins`                 |
| Connections          | Too many open connections (>10k)        | `>10,000 connections`               |
| Replication Lag      | Slave lagging behind master (>10s)      | `>10s for 5 mins`                   |
| Key Evictions        | High rate of key evictions (>100/min)   | `>100 evictions/min`                |
| Failed Commands      | Command execution failures (>5/min)     | `>5 failures/min`                   |

## Alert Severity Levels

| Severity | Description                                                             | Example        |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Critical | System outage or severe degradation requiring immediate action.         | CPU usage >90% |
| High     | Performance degradation or risk of failure; needs prompt investigation. | CPU usage >70% |
| Medium   | Non-critical issues that may impact performance if unaddressed.         | CPU usage >50% |
| Low      | Informational alerts for tracking or minor anomalies.                   | CPU usage >30% |

## Notification Channels  

| Channel               | Purpose                        | Tool/Integration             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Slack `#redis-alerts` | Real-time alerts & discussions | Integrated with Alertmanager |
| Email                 | Daily summary or escalations   | SMTP/Email relay             |
| Grafana Dashboard     | Visual monitoring & history    | Live dashboard & drilldowns  |

## Escalation Process

### First-Level Escalation (L1 - On-Call Engineer)  
- **Action**: Acknowledge alert, perform initial triage.  
- **Timeframe**:  
  - Critical: **5 mins**  
  - High: **15 mins**  
  - Medium: **1 hour**  

### Second-Level Escalation (L2 - Middleware SME)  
- **Trigger**: If unresolved after **30 mins (Critical)** or **2 hours (High)**.  
- **Action**: Deep dive into logs, apply fixes, coordinate with infra/database teams.  

### Third-Level Escalation (L3 - Engineering/Management)  
- **Trigger**: If issue persists beyond **1 hour (Critical)** or **4 hours (High)**.  
- **Action**: Major incident declared, war room initiated, post-mortem required.

## Review & Continuous Improvement  
- Weekly review of false positives/negatives.  
- Quarterly updates to thresholds based on historical trends.
