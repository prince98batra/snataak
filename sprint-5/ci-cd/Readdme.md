## What is Terraform CI/CD?

Terraform CI/CD is a continuous integration and deployment process tailored for infrastructure-as-code. It automates the validation, testing, and secure deployment of Terraform modules, ensuring that every change is checked for compliance, correctness, and cost impact before it is applied.

## Why CI/CD for Terraform Modules?

| Goal           | Benefit                                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automation     | Speeds up deployments and reduces manual errors           |
| Code Quality   | Catches mistakes early—before they affect production      |
| Security       | Scans for risks like open ports or public buckets         |
| Cost Awareness | Highlights resource cost changes during development       |
| Governance     | Applies rules like required tags, region limits, etc.     |
| Audit Trail    | CI/CD logs every step—making debugging and reviews easier |

---

## CI Workflow Overview

This workflow runs automatically when code is pushed or a pull request is opened. It ensures the Terraform code is validated and secure before being merged.

| Step                  | Tool/Command                 | Purpose                                                           | Best Practice                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Linting               | `tflint`                     | Checks for syntax errors, naming issues, and Terraform formatting | Use organization-specific rules for naming and tags  |
| Security Scanning     | `tfsec`                      | Detects cloud security risks like open ports or public S3 buckets | Fail builds for critical vulnerabilities             |
| Compliance Validation | `checkov`                    | Validates configuration against org-wide compliance policies      | Enforce policy-as-code for regulatory standards      |
| Cost Estimation       | `infracost`                  | Estimates monthly cost of resources and shows diffs in PRs        | Include cost estimates in PR reviews                 |
| Terraform Plan        | `terraform plan -out=tfplan` | Displays what infrastructure changes will occur                   | Store plan files as artifacts for approval and audit |

Note: The CI pipeline **only validates** code. It does not apply changes.

---

## CD Workflow Overview

This workflow runs after the code is merged to a main or environment-specific branch. It re-validates all checks before applying infrastructure changes.

| Step                | Tool/Command             | Purpose                                                           | Best Practice                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Re-run Checks       | `checkov`, `tfsec`       | Ensures code is still secure and compliant post-merge             | Avoids drift between review and deployment     |
| Terraform Apply     | `terraform apply tfplan` | Applies the reviewed and approved changes to cloud infrastructure | Use manual approvals or protected environments |
| Output Verification | `terraform output`       | Exports and stores key outputs for use in downstream systems      | Archive outputs for audit and traceability     |

---

## Tools Used

| Tool         | Purpose                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Terraform    | Infrastructure as Code engine                                         |
| TFLint       | Enforces Terraform style and syntax standards                         |
| TFSEC        | Performs static analysis to detect security vulnerabilities in code   |
| Checkov      | Validates compliance with custom and organizational policies          |
| Infracost    | Provides cost estimation based on proposed infrastructure changes     |
| CI/CD Engine | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps for orchestration |

---

## Best Practices

| Area             | Recommendation                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local Validation | Use `pre-commit` hooks with `fmt`, `validate`, and `tflint` before pushing code |
| Security         | Fail CI if `tfsec` or `checkov` finds critical issues                           |
| Cost Visibility  | Use `infracost` to add resource cost diffs in pull requests                     |
| Separation       | CI = validate and estimate; CD = apply after approvals                          |
| State Management | Use remote backend (S3 + DynamoDB) for locking and consistency                  |
| Secrets          | Use Vault, Secrets Manager, or environment variables for sensitive data         |

## Deployment Lifecycle

| Stage                  | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Pushed            | CI pipeline runs linting, security, compliance, cost, and plan checks |
| Code Reviewed          | Team reviews output from CI, including cost and plan details          |
| Code Merged            | CD pipeline runs, re-checks security/compliance, and applies changes  |
| Infrastructure Applied | Approved changes are deployed safely and logged                       |
| Post-Deploy            | Outputs are exported for reuse, and system state is verified          |

---

## Conclusion

This document specifically said that CI/CD improves the security, consistency, and quality of Terraform module deployments. By automating validation, compliance, and cost checks, teams reduce risk and manual effort. Further enhancements can include drift detection, monitoring, and governance using Terraform Cloud.
