## **What is Database Version Control?**

- **Database Version Control**: A method to keep a record of every change made to a database.
- **Version Control Files**: Changes are saved as scripts or files in a shared folder or tool like Git.
- **Change Ordering**: Each change has a number or name to ensure it is applied in the correct order.
- **Team Collaboration**: Helps everyone know what changes were made, by whom, and when.
- **Error Reduction**: Reduces mistakes and avoids confusion in team projects.

## **Why Use Database Version Control?**

- **Easy Tracking**: Know what changed in the database and who changed it.
- **Team Work**: Helps many team members work on the same database without issues.
- **Safe Updates**: Makes it easier to fix problems if something goes wrong.
- **Same Changes Everywhere**: Ensures that changes are the same in development, testing, and live systems.
- **Faster Releases**: Works well with tools that help release new updates quickly.
- **Audit-Friendly**: Useful for companies that must keep proper records for checks or reviews.

## **Available Tools**

- **Flyway**: A simple and quick tool for managing database changes with numbered files, ideal for smaller teams.
- **Liquibase**: A more flexible tool that tracks changes using named files and supports undoing changes, great for larger teams.
- **Alembic**: A Python-specific tool for managing database changes with small scripts, perfect for Python projects.
